# First Draft of DC Project/Peer Review

Please upload your first draft of your paper by **midnight on Saturday, 8/22**, here. You will be assigned **two** first drafts by your peers to review; follow the Straub article for advice on how to productively give feedback to your peers that will help them revise toward their next draft. You must include a **cover memo** at the beginning of your document. Please follow the cover memo example under the Week 3 module. Your first draft must be at least **1000** words. Please double-space and use Times New Roman. 

**Your peer review feedback to both peers must be returned by midnight, Tuesday, 8/25 (no exceptions). You must answer the questions on the peer review worksheet that is given in the Week 3 module for each person's paper you're reviewing. You can answer the questions at the end of their draft.**

*If there is an issue or confusion, please email me right away--I usually do peer review as an in-class assignment and I'm hoping this will work smoothly, but if we hit a bump, I can adjust, you just need to let me know right away.*

Remember rhetorical strategies include (connotations, denotations, pathos, ethos, logos, tone, word choice, style, etc). I want you think about the strategies these abolitionist organizations use to convey their messages to members, to the public, to the state/the government...various audiences. 

Remember you're looking for continuities (patterns) or discontinuities in the data (use of social media, rhetoric/discourse) of your organization compared to the secondary scholarship broadly on prison abolition. Be sure to have your own "I wonder why they use x method" type questions...these can be helpful ways of understanding your research question and help you narrow the focus of your argument/thesis in your paper. A thesis is an attempt to hypothesize a possible answer to a research question. If this feels really new and unfamiliar to you, then you can use this very *very* broad question to help guide your research and your ideas:

*How does your organization use and rely on rhetoric (language and image) to promote and engage with prison abolition?*

This first draft should include a *tentative* thesis and some engagement between evidence from your organization (primary source) and secondary sources (peer-reviewed articles/chapters).
