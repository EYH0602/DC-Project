# Revised Draft of DC Project

**Revision Pro-tip**: Save each draft as a separate word document rather than simply revising one document. Why? Sometimes scholars have great ideas from an earlier draft that they take out in a revision and then decide that they want to re-introduce that information. If they did not have separate files then that information would be completely lost. Sometimes I have ten or more drafts of my articles and dissertation chapters. Save files as "DC Project First Draft," "DC Project Revised Draft," and "DC Project Final Draft" (or however many drafts you write of this particular research-argumentative paper). 

Please upload your revised draft (second draft) of your DC project. **This draft must be at minimum 1400 words.** Your draft should include: an introduction, body paragraphs with textual and image analyses, topic sentences and transitions, use of 5 secondary sources (at least 4 peer-reviewed), MLA citations, a conclusion, and a works cited page.  

With the revised draft, you will have a one-on-one 20 minute office hour with me during Week 5. (for which you will sign-up for this week, Week 4). To help me prep for our meeting, you must include a cover memo. The cover memo for the one-on-one conference should be one paragraph describing what you think the strengths and weaknesses of the draft are, one paragraph with any questions or concerns you have for me, and one paragraph summarizing the feedback you got from your peer responders and what revisions you made based on your peers' responses. The last component--summarizing peer feedback and what revisions you made is ***the*** most important part of this **cover memo**, so please prioritize this information. 

You will get the full 25 points if you: submit a revised draft, sign-up for your office hour appointment, and attend it. 

## Cover Memo

<!--- pros and cons --->

The strengths of this paper, according to the peer reviews as well, lie in its specific, focused central claim and clear structure. Accurate, relevant secondary sources are also used properly to provide solid evidence. By analyzing the power of storytelling from three aspects, the paper offers well-organized sub-claims which build up to support the main thesis.

<!--- questions or concerns ---> 

I got the inspiration of analyzing storytelling as a rhetorical strategy from one of the previous course assignments, an interview-based bibliography of a family member. When I interviewed my grandmother in a formal way, I found she told some stories differently from what she did before. Storytelling worked in an interesting way to construct and reconstruct meanings. Before working on this paper, I referred to some literature on storytelling in prison abolition movement and found surprisingly storytelling has been used as a political tool to promote social change. So, it is not original to analyze the power of storytelling in prison abolition movement, but I learned a lot from reading scholarship on storytelling, based on which I composed my first formal research paper. 

<!--- Summarizing peer feedback --->

Besides the lack of originality in structure, I have also concern about the analysis part in the paper. According to the one of the peer reviews, it would be better if more analysis is added before and after the citation, which I managed to do in the second draft. Another peer review points out my conclusion is a little weak, which I havenâ€™t revised dramatically in this draft because of time and length constraint, but I will revise it in the final draft. Other revisions I have made after reading peer reviews also include 

1. to balance the weight of citations and my own voice; 

2. to add better transitions within paragraphs, especially after citations. 

Finally, I am not sure about the format of long quotes. I adopted the formatting instructed on the OWL website, with $\frac{1}{2}$ inch indent from the left margin, while some websites state it should be 1 inch.
