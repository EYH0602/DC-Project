\section{Thesis}

In the past decades, more undocumented youth have come of the shadows to struggle against the criminalization and discrimination they encountered and fight for their rights in community, society, and the United States. 
Among the surging youth-led alliances, California Immigrant Youth Justice Alliance (CIYJA) is one of the most influential organizations that focus on placing undocumented youth in advocacy and policy delegations. 
By strategically employing empowering practices, CIYJA launches a transformational movement that goes beyond narrowly defined legalization and attempts to gain radical egalitarian citizenship.
This paper focuses on their strategies of storytelling and organizing diverse communities, analyzes and argues how these practices give voice to community members, expand the Dreamer narrative, and mobilize undocumented youth as well as the public.
