# DC Project Outline

## Thesis

By using ethos, pathos, and logos, CIJYA sufficiently and effectively conveys its idea to the public and the government, evoking more and more people to support its abolition movement.

## Ethos

* [letter to Attorney General](https://ciyja.org/mvhungerstrike/) and [statement to sheriff](https://ciyja.org/oc-jails-statement/) show that CIJYA and other organizations are really doing the work, adding credibility to its articles calling for action and conveying ideas.



## Pathos / diction

* When CIJYA talks about government policy, statements and related subjects, it always use "we" to denote the immigrant community and often use verb like "must", "will not", and "first" to appeal to audience's emotion in many of [its articles](https://ciyja.org/category/opinions/).

    * By always using "we" as the pronoun, the audiences will know that CIJYA is on their side against the government, even they do not know what is CIJYA.
        * CIJYA use this method to make itself looks like the representation of the whole undocumented youth community (or even the whole prison abolition community) to draw more audience for its opinions and articles, which makes their opinions and articles more influential.
        * highlight the collective identity of this community
    * By constantly using "must", "will not", and "first" in the title of articles, CIJYA gives the audience a short spoiler at beginning, and this spoiler makes the audiences more interested in reading this article to find out why.

* Some articles are based on real case events, for example, [the experience of Valeria Suarez](https://ciyja.org/freedvaleria/). 
    * To lead other people in the community to notice CIJYA
    * show its ability to solve the problem by calling all community into action

## connotation

* Free Them All at the gate of California Governor Gavin Newsom’s mansion
    * <img src="https://secureservercdn.net/ip-ac.mwp2.iad2.godaddy.com/34z.716.godaddywp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Free-Them-ALL.jpg" alt="Free Them All 14" style="zoom: 25%;" /> 
    * The leader in front is in gray suit, white shirt and a colorful tie, but other members are in black suits. Why there is a different in their dressing style? 
        * The man in the front is the leader, communicator, and negotiator, so he needs to dress up more formal to show that he is a proper person to talk to.
        * The others are in all black cloths. Black represents death and sadness，which indicates that 14-year-old undocumented children may be facing danger of living in the prisons.
    * They are wearing three layers of disease protections: a face shield, a black mask with "Free Them All!" slogan in yellow, and a medical mask underneath.
        * In the current COVID condition, wearing masks means to protect themselves. Wearing three of them means protect as much as you can (normally one is enough). 
        * They are setting in front of the gate of California Governor Gavin Newsom’s mansion, this is telling immigrants to protect themselves from the government and politicians. 
        * What does the yellow slogan means?
    * They are locked up, not by themselves, not to the gate, but to each other.
        * This is telling that their strongest weapon is the collective identity.
        * Locked up setting in front of a iron gate, this looks like in jail.
            * Can 14-year-olds children see this picture in the prison?
            * If they can, is this picture saying that they should unit and work together in prison for themselves?
    * The two in front are looking at somewhere while others are staring at the camera.
        * What are the two front people looking at? Their enemies?
        * The others staring at the camera and that only man in the background (out of focus), are they asking for help?
